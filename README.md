# Learning React ⚛️

This repository documents my journey of learning **React.js** — from fundamentals to building real-world applications.  
The goal is to understand React **properly**, not just use it blindly.

---

## 📌 Why React?
- Build fast, interactive user interfaces
- Component-based & reusable architecture
- Industry-standard for modern frontend development
- Essential for full-stack and ML-based web applications

---

## 🧠 Prerequisites
Before starting React, I revised:
- JavaScript (ES6+)
  - let / const
  - arrow functions
  - destructuring
  - spread operator
  - array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- DOM manipulation
- APIs & Fetch
- Promises & async/await
- Basic browser behavior (event loop intuition)

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
### Core React
- JSX
- Functional Components
- Props
- State (`useState`)
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Lists & keys

### Side Effects & Data
- `useEffect`
- API calls in React
- Controlled components (forms)
- Lifting state up

### Application Structure
- Component composition
- Folder structure
- Reusable components
- React Router (basic)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML & CSS
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code
- Vite / Create React App
- Netlify / Vercel (deployment)

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand React’s **declarative** approach
- Write clean, maintainable components
- Build production-style projects
- Connect frontend with APIs / backend
- Prepare for full-stack & ML-based applications

---

## 🚀 Projects (Planned / Built)
- Todo App
- API-based Dashboard
- Form Handling App
- Mini Full-Stack Project
- ML Result Visualization UI

---

## 📈 Progress Philosophy
- Learn by building
- Avoid tutorial dependency
- Focus on fundamentals over libraries
- Prefer clarity over shortcuts

---

## 🧩 Future Scope
- Advanced hooks
- Performance optimization
- State management basics
- Integration with backend / ML models

---

## 📎 Note
This repository reflects **learning in progress**.  
Code quality and structure will improve as concepts deepen.
